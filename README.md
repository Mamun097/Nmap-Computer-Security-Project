# Nmap-Computer-Security-Project

## Project Overview

This project is all about exploring various features of the network scanning tool: <b>Nmap</b>, developed as part of the <b>CSE-406 Computer Security Sessional</b>. Nmap is mainly designed for network reconnaissance and security auditing.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

### 1. Host Discovery

Nmap excels at discovering hosts on a network. It utilizes various techniques such as ICMP echo requests, TCP handshake, and UDP discovery to identify live hosts.

### 2. Port Scanning

The tool supports multiple port scanning techniques, including:

- **TCP Connect Scan:** Establishes a full TCP connection to each port to determine if it's open.
  
- **SYN Stealth Scan:** Utilizes SYN packets to determine open ports without completing the full connection.

- **UDP Scan:** Scans for open UDP ports, important for services that use UDP for communication.

### 3. Service Version Detection

Nmap can detect the version of services running on open ports, providing valuable information for security assessments.

### 4. Operating System Detection

The tool incorporates OS detection capabilities, allowing users to identify the operating systems of target hosts.

### 5. Aggressive Scanning

An aggressive scan option (-A) enables a comprehensive scan by combining various scan types, service version detection, and operating system detection.

### 6. Scripting Engine

Nmap's scripting engine allows users to run custom scripts to automate tasks or gather more information during scans.
